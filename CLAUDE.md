# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"Cal AI" — a React Native calorie tracking app built with Expo SDK 54 and expo-router v6 (file-based routing). Users photograph meals for automatic calorie tracking. The app has a multi-step onboarding flow (26 screens) and a tabbed main interface.

## Commands

- `npx expo start` — start the dev server
- `npx expo start --android` / `--ios` / `--web` — start for a specific platform
- `npm run lint` (runs `expo lint`) — lint with ESLint flat config
- `npm run reset-project` — moves starter code to `app-example/` and creates a blank `app/`

No test runner is configured.

## Architecture

### Routing (expo-router, file-based)

- `app/_layout.tsx` — Root Stack: wrapped in `GestureHandlerRootView`, loads Nunito fonts from Google Fonts URLs, manages splash screen
- `app/index.tsx` — Entry redirect: sends to `/(tabs)` if onboarding complete, else `/onboarding`
- `app/onboarding/_layout.tsx` — Stack with `slide_from_right` transitions; 26 screens across 3 phases (Basics, Body & Goals, Lifestyle) plus transitions, plan generation, account creation, and paywall
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — Bottom tabs (home, progress, profile) with a custom tab bar (`CustomTabBar`)

### State Management

- Zustand store at `store/onboarding-store.ts` — holds all onboarding data (`OnboardingPayload`) and completion state. Not persisted (resets on app restart).
- Notable store fields: `weekendDays` is `string[]` (array of day names), `weeklyGoalSpeed` is a number (kg/week).

### Theming & Styling

- `constants/theme.ts` — single `Theme` object with colors, fonts (Nunito family), and border radii. Warm palette: coral primary (`#E2856E`), cream background (`#FFFAF5`).
- All styling uses `StyleSheet.create` with `Theme` constants. No external styling library.

### Key Conventions

- Path alias: `@/*` maps to project root (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- React Compiler and typed routes are enabled (`app.json` experiments)
- New Architecture enabled (`newArchEnabled: true`)
- Reusable onboarding components in `components/onboarding/` (ProgressHeader, OnboardingButton, ListButton, CardOption, UnitToggle, ScrollPicker)
- Shared utilities in `utils/`:
  - `target-date.ts` — calculates estimated goal date from weight difference and weekly speed

### ScrollPicker Component

The `ScrollPicker` uses scroll-offset-based selection (`Math.round(contentOffset.y / ITEM_HEIGHT)`). Do NOT use `onViewableItemsChanged` — it unreliably detects the center item. Apple-style design: thin separator lines, opacity fade, bold for selected. For multi-picker screens, use `hideLines` prop and render shared separator lines in the parent `pickerRow`. Exports `PICKER_ITEM_HEIGHT`, `PICKER_VISIBLE_ITEMS`, `PICKER_CENTER` for parent layout.

### Navigation Patterns

- `generating.tsx` uses `router.replace` (not push) to navigate to `custom-plan` — prevents back-loop where the auto-timer re-fires
- Back button touch targets must be at least 44x44px with `hitSlop` — smaller targets are untappable on real devices
- Bottom action padding: all onboarding screens use `paddingBottom: 36`

### Known Workarounds

- `expo-notifications` barrel import is broken in SDK 54 (missing `unregisterForNotificationsAsync`). Import directly from `expo-notifications/build/NotificationPermissions` instead.

### Design Prototypes

- `_design_prototypes/` contains HTML mockups (onboarding and in-app screens) used as visual references for implementation
